SIGNALS
=======

:code:`SIGHUP`
    Cause OpenVPN to close all TUN/TAP and network connections, restart,
    re-read the configuration file (if any), and reopen TUN/TAP and network
    connections.

:code:`SIGUSR1`
    Like :code:`SIGHUP`, except don't re-read configuration file, and
    possibly don't close and reopen TUN/TAP device, re-read key files,
    preserve local IP address/port, or preserve most recently authenticated
    remote IP address/port based on ``--persist-tun``, ``--persist-key``,
    ``--persist-local-ip`` and ``--persist-remote-ip`` options respectively
    (see above).

    This signal may also be internally generated by a timeout condition,
    governed by the ``--ping-restart`` option.

    This signal, when combined with ``--persist-remote-ip``, may be sent
    when the underlying parameters of the host's network interface change
    such as when the host is a DHCP client and is assigned a new IP address.
    See ``--ipchange`` for more information.

--persist-local-ip
  Preserve initially resolved local IP address and port number across
  ``SIGUSR1`` or ``--ping-restart`` restarts.

--persist-remote-ip
  Preserve most recently authenticated remote IP address and port number
  across :code:`SIGUSR1` or ``--ping-restart`` restarts.
